Assembling the Delta Arm on a Stationary Test Rack 


And now we have a working robot!

After a successful month of design and manufacturing, we've assembled our first prototype delta arm, and Aaron was able to validate the inverse kinematics! Some calibration is needed, but we have successfully been able to identify a "weed" and position the delta arm end effector over top of it. 

A few hurdles we've taken: loose tolerances in the original ball joints we ordered led to an extremely shaky end effector. To mitigate this, I investigated existing delta arm designs and realized that many had tensioned forearms (the aluminum rods in our case), and by putting elastics on ours, the positional accuracy was greatly increased.
