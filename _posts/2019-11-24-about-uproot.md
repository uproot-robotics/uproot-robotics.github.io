UpRoot Robotics is a University of Waterloo Capstone Design Team looking to advance agriculture by developing a chemical-free autonomous weeding solution.


## Problem Space
We are targeting high-value horticultural crops for this project, focussing on Romaine Lettuce produced in the Holland Marsh, right here in Ontario.

## Problem Approach
We will be designing a modular system to be mounted on existing autonomous chassis. Our scope will consist of the following:
1. Base platform with compute stack and motor control.
1. Actuator system with end effector to destroy weeds.
1. Weed detection and targeting pipeline.
