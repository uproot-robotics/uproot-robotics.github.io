Our poster, generously printed by Westmount Signs, was unfortunately never displayed in public due to the symposium being cancelled over rising COVID-19 concerns.

We were so disappointed that we couldn't bring our demo to everyone in real life, however we're counting our blessings that we're all still in good health. 

Fortunately, we filmed a demo of boy working hard and taking out weeds in the lab garden!
