## The Epic

A wise man told us that the state of our wires might scare small children and the elderly... We heeded his advice and embarked on a quest to enclose the nest of the rat using whatever resources we had available to us, be that services of the people, metal of the gods, or Thor's hammer itself. Turns out all we needed was a press brake and a bit of genius from our favorite techs at the Engineering Student Machine Shop.

I took a sheet of 6061 aluminum generously abandoned in the Mechatronics Surplus System and drew up our electronic systems and all of their pertinent internal and external connections.

## The Plan

The press brake in the shop was unfortunately not accommodating enough to enable the completion of the enclosure folding. With a bit of brainstorming with the technicians in the shop, however, we were able to come up with a brilliant solution to finish off the last two bends! The result was a gorgeous enclosure for all of our electronics.
