UpRoot Robotics is a University of Waterloo Capstone Design Team looking to advance agriculture by developing a chemical-free autonomous weeding solution.


## Problem Space
We are targeting high-value horticultural crops for this project, focussing on Romaine Lettuce produced in the Holland Marsh, right here in Ontario.
