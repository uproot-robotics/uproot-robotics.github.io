While things were slow over the holidays, the team has been quick to ramp up this term, tackling a lot of work in these first 2 weeks!

## Delta Arm
Here's John showing us some preliminary movement from the first Delta arm prototype. Motors are mounted, and we are working on integrating our controls software.

We've got tons of parts coming in all the time, so we're hoping we can keep pushing with our build!
